# - Find the XdgQt include and library dirs and define a some macros
#
# The module defines the following variables
#  XDGQT_FOUND         - Set to TRUE if all of the above has been found
#
#  XDGQT_INCLUDE_DIR   - The XdgQt include directory
#
#  XDGQT_INCLUDE_DIRS  - The XdgQt include directory
#
#  XDGQT_LIBRARIES     - The libraries needed to use XdgQt
#
#  XDGQT_USE_FILE      - The variable XDGQT_USE_FILE is set which is the path
#                        to a CMake file that can be included to compile xdgqt
#                        applications and libraries. It sets up the compilation
#                        environment for include directories and populates a
#                        XDGQT_LIBRARIES variable.
#
# XDGQT_QT_LIBRARIES   - The Qt libraries needed by XdgQt
#
# Typical usage:
#    option(USE_QT5 "Build using Qt5. Default off" OFF)
#    if (USE_QT5)
#        find_package(XdgQt5)
#    else()
#        find_package(XdgQt4)
#    endif()
#
#    include(${XDGQT_USE_FILE})
#    add_executable(use-xdgqt main.cpp)
#    target_link_libraries(use-xdgqt ${XDGQT_QT_LIBRARIES} ${XDGQT_LIBRARIES})
